        Use PIR to activate TFT display. Set to off after delay?
        Use light sensor to control TFT brightness
        Use individual DotStar LEDs to show status (GYR?)
        Decide on power conservation: two modes?

    The basics are working
    LED usage
        Individually control dotstar LEDs like this:
            funhouse.peripherals.dotstars[2] = (16, 16, 16)
        Funhouse has six LEDs. Usage:
            [x] main LED: on when uploading: funhouse.peripherals.led = True
            Use dotstars in alpha order:
                [n/a] barometer: no LED
                [] dots[0] - CO2: color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red
                [] dots[1] - humidity: orange (low) - green (OK) - red (high)
                [n/a] light level no LED
                [x] dots[2] - PIR: white
                    [] fades with time?
                [] dots[3] - temperature: color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red
                [] dots[4] - VOC: color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red

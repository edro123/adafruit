                adafruit IO
                    [no] Local Weather and forecast inputs??? use pushbuttons for menu? select local weather? Why?
        Data Outputs:
            [x] Print to Internal TFT display
            adafruit dashboard
                [x] temperature

            Speaker / buzzer ???
            [x] Five mini DotStar LEDs
            [x] adafruit dashboard
    Processing:
        [no] Use PIR to activate TFT display. Set to off after delay?
        [no] Use light sensor to control TFT brightness
        [] Decide on power conservation: 
            two modes? 
            no worries unles battery powered
            Use small power bank like with zoom H6?
        [no] I/F with Raspberry Pis. Just display web page on Pi.

    The basics are working
    LED usage
        Individually control dotstar LEDs like this:
            funhouse.peripherals.dotstars[2] = (16, 16, 16)
        Funhouse has six LEDs. Usage:
            [x] main LED: on when uploading: funhouse.peripherals.led = True
            Use dotstars in alpha order:
                [n/a] barometer: no LED
                [x] dots[0] - CO2: color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red

                [x] dots[1] - humidity: orange (low) - green (OK) - red (high)
                [n/a] light level no LED
                [x] dots[2] - PIR: white
                    [NO] fades with time?
                [x] dots[3] - temperature: color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red
                [x] dots[4] - VOC: color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red

    Next:
        [x] Add a function for humidity and temperature LEDs
        [] Code clean up
            [x] Consolodate constants
            [] try except?
            test for or protect against non-existent sensors 
                use constants
                    [x] SGP30
                    [] PIR
        [x] standalone test sgp 30
        [x] add sgp 30 CO2 and VOC
            [x] read sensors
            [x] update LED colors based on measurements
        [] ten hour calibration
    Future:
        Modes? 
            [x] nightlight???
                on motion detect:
                    turn on led[2] for one cycle
                    if it's dark and brightness is zero: turn all dotstar LEDs on full bright for one cycle
            [x] auto TFT / LED brightness
            Away mode:
                immediate notification of motion detect to Raspberry Pi
                slow email notification via IFTT
        [x] add cpu temperature: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-funhouse/cpu-temperature

    [] SGP 30 test / debug
        works standalone
        
    [] Can LED brightness control be re-factored?

    Processing:
        ???
        Use PIR to activate TFT display. Set to off after delay?
        Use light sensor to control TFT brightness
        Use individual DotStar LEDs to show status (GYR?)
        Decide on power conservation: two modes?

    The basics are working
    LED usage
        To individually control dotstar LEDs like this (doesn't work?):
            import time
            import board
            import adafruit_dotstar
            dots = adafruit_dotstar.DotStar(board.DOTSTAR_CLOCK, board.DOTSTAR_DATA, 5)
            dots.brightness = 0.1
            dots[2]=((255, 0, 0))
            time.sleep(0.5)
            dots[2]=((0, 255, 0))
            time.sleep(0.5)
            dots[2]=((0, 0, 255))
            time.sleep(0.5)
        Funhouse has six LEDs. Usage:
            [x] main LED: on when uploading: funhouse.peripherals.led = True
            [n/a] barometer: no LED
            [] CO2: dots[0] - color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red
            [] humidity: dots[1] - orange (low) green (OK) red (high)
            [n/a] light level no LED
            [] PIR: dots[2] - white. fades with time?
            [] temperature: dots[3] - color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red
            [] VOC: dots[4] - color varies with level, blue - green - yellow - red
        Hmm. get in use errors with dotstar LEDs. Because of the way Funhouse inits them???
